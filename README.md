# Audio Splitter
Audio Splitter is a lightweight and simple browser extension to route tab sound to left or right audio channel.
It supports capturing and routing sound from two separate browser tabs simultaneously.

Now you can watch two YouTube videos / Twitch streams at a time â€“ pure ADHD experience for people who believe their brain can process all that.

Supports Chromium (Chrome, Thorium, Brave, Edge, Opera...) and Firefox based browsers.
